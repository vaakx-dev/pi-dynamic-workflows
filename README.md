Turn one request into a JavaScript orchestration script that fans work out across isolated subagents, routes each task to the right model, cross-checks the results, and returns one synthesized answer. Intermediate work stays in script variables instead of filling your chat context.

Built for **codebase-wide audits, multi-perspective review, large refactors, and source-checked research**—the jobs that are too broad for one agent and one context window.

![A real pi-dynamic-workflows run showing parallel agents and live progress](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaakx-dev/pi-dynamic-workflows/main/docs/media/demo.gif)

## Start in 30 seconds

```bash
pi install npm:@vaakx-dev/pi-dynamic-workflows
```

Run `/reload` in Pi, then ask naturally:

```text
Run a workflow to audit every route under src/routes/ for missing auth checks.
```

Pi writes and starts the workflow in the background. A live panel tracks progress while you keep working, and the final result is delivered back into the conversation automatically.

Ordinary messages are never rewritten based on words they contain, including **workflow** and **workflows**. To execute a workflow explicitly, use `/workflows run <prompt>`, call the `workflow` tool, or use a saved workflow command. Standing `/effort high|ultra` remains available as an explicit session opt-in for substantive messages.

## How it works

![A prompt becomes deterministic orchestration, parallel routed agents, verification, and one result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaakx-dev/pi-dynamic-workflows/main/assets/readme/workflow.png)

1. **Orchestrate** — Pi writes a deterministic JavaScript workflow with `agent()`, `parallel()`, `pipeline()`, and `phase()`.
2. **Fan out** — fresh subagent sessions run concurrently, optionally on different models or isolated git worktrees.
3. **Verify and return** — the workflow cross-checks findings, journals completed work for resume, and delivers one result.

The orchestration itself is plain JavaScript:

```js
export const meta = {
  name: 'auth_audit',
  description: 'Find routes missing auth checks and verify the findings',
  phases: [{ title: 'Scan' }, { title: 'Review' }, { title: 'Verify' }],
}

phase('Scan')
const files = await agent('List every route file under src/routes/.', { tier: 'small' })

phase('Review')
const findings = await parallel(
  files.split('\n').filter(Boolean).map((file) =>
    () => agent(`Audit ${file} for missing auth checks.`, {
      tier: 'medium',
      isolation: 'worktree',
    }),
  ),
)

phase('Verify')
return await agent(
  'Synthesize and double-check these findings:\n' + findings.join('\n\n'),
  { tier: 'big' },
)
```

## Why use it

- **Real parallel orchestration** — fan out up to 16 concurrent and 1000 total subagents from one orchestration script.
- **Per-agent model routing** — use `small`, `medium`, or `big` tiers, or choose an exact provider/model and thinking level.
- **Journaled resume** — replay completed agents after interruption without rerunning them or spending their tokens again. The orchestrator can also resume with an **edited script** (`resumeFromRunId`): unchanged `agent()` calls replay from cache and only edited/new ones re-run — so a single bad prompt no longer means paying to re-run the whole workflow.
- **Git worktree isolation** — let parallel agents edit safely on throwaway branches with `isolation: "worktree"`.
- **Measured usage** — report real tokens and cost from each subagent session; add run, phase, or agent budgets only when you want them.
- **Visible background runs** — track phases, agents, models, fresh/cache tokens, cost, and live tok/s from the progress panel or `/workflows` navigator.
- **Quality patterns** — compose `verify()`, `judgePanel()`, `loopUntilDry()`, and `completenessCheck()` instead of rebuilding review loops.
- **Reusable workflows** — save any run as a command and call saved workflows from other workflows.

## Built-in workflows

```text
/deep-research <question>   source-checked web research with citations
/adversarial-review <task>  findings challenged by skeptical reviewers
/multi-perspective "<topic>" [angle …]
                            independent angles followed by synthesis
/code-review [target]       7 parallel review angles plus verification
/codebase-audit <scope> "<check>" …
                            parallel checks followed by cross-validation
```

`/code-review` defaults to the current working diff. It also accepts a git range, a file, or a GitHub PR number:

```text
/code-review
/code-review HEAD~3..HEAD
/code-review src/foo.ts
/code-review 42
```

For an always-on exhaustive mode, use `/ultracode`; `/effort high` is the lighter standing option.

## Commands and run control

Pi can manage background runs directly with the `workflow_control` tool instead of asking you to type a command. It supports `list`, `status`, `pause`, `resume`, and `stop`; run-specific actions use the canonical run ID returned when the workflow starts. Status output includes the run state, current phase, agent counts, active labels, and recorded token total.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/workflows` | Open the interactive run navigator |
| `/workflows run <prompt>` | Explicitly execute a workflow for a prompt |
| `/workflows status <id>` | Watch a run and print its result when complete |
| `/workflows pause\|resume\|stop\|rm <id>` | Control a run |
| `/workflows save <name>` | Save the latest script as a reusable command |
| `/workflows-progress compact\|detailed\|status\|max <N>` | Live-panel detail level (and max agents shown per phase in detailed mode) |
| `/workflows-models` | Map model tiers and thinking levels |
| `/ultracode [off]` | Toggle exhaustive automatic workflows |
| `/effort off\|high\|ultra` | Set the standing orchestration effort |

In the navigator: `↑/↓` select · `enter/→` open · `esc/←` back · `p` pause · `x` stop · `r` restart · `s` save · `q` quit.

## Runtime reference

| Global | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `agent(prompt, opts)` | Spawn an isolated subagent; optionally validate its result with JSON Schema |
| `parallel(thunks)` | Run `() => agent(...)` thunks concurrently and preserve input order |
| `pipeline(items, ...stages)` | Fan items through sequential stages |
| `phase(title, { budget? })` | Group work in the live view and optionally set a phase budget |
| `verify` / `judgePanel` | Cross-check a result or choose the best candidate |

The [full documentation](https://vaakx-dev.github.io/pi-dynamic-workflows/) covers every option, structured output, determinism, saved workflows, and operational control.

<details>
<summary><strong>Model tiers and run controls</strong></summary>

Model tiers live at `~/.pi/workflows/model-tiers.json` and accept Pi CLI-style thinking suffixes:

```json
{
  "tiers": {
    "small": "openai-codex/gpt-5.4-mini:low",
    "medium": "openai-codex/gpt-5.4:medium",
    "big": "openai-codex/gpt-5.5:xhigh"
  }
}
```

Use `/workflows-models` to edit them interactively. Without a config, the extension ranks authenticated models by capability hints and assigns distinct models when possible.

Runs have no default token budget or per-agent hard timeout. Add `tokenBudget`, `agentTimeoutMs`, phase budgets, or agent `timeoutMs` when you need explicit gates. `concurrency` is clamped to 16; `agentRetries` retries only recoverable failures. Defaults can be set in `~/.pi/workflows/settings.json` — e.g. `defaultTokenBudget` applies a hard budget to every run that doesn't pass its own `tokenBudget` (a project-level override of `null` cancels a global budget).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Storage, resume, and persisted sessions</strong></summary>

Extension state lives outside the repository under `~/.pi/workflows`:

- global settings and tiers: `~/.pi/workflows/settings.json` and `model-tiers.json`
- project runs, journals, locks, and saved overrides: `~/.pi/workflows/projects/<project>/`
- older project-local `.pi/workflows/runs` and `.pi/workflows/saved` remain readable as fallbacks

Subagents are in-memory by default. Set `persistAgentSessions: true` to retain full transcripts in Pi's standard session directory. This creates one file per agent and may store sensitive material that an agent read, so enable it deliberately.

Completed background runs persist their full result in the project run JSON. The conversation delivery includes a pointer to that file when the visible summary is shortened.

<summary><strong>How it maps to Claude Code dynamic workflows</strong></summary>

| Claude Code dynamic workflows | pi-dynamic-workflows on Pi |
| --- | --- |
| Code-mode orchestration | JavaScript `agent()` / `parallel()` / `pipeline()` / `phase()` in a VM realm (for determinism, not a security boundary) |
| Isolated subagent contexts | Fresh in-memory Pi sessions; results remain in variables |
| Structured outputs | JSON Schema validation with bounded repair |
| Background runs | Non-blocking run, live panel, and automatic result delivery |
| Resume | Journaled replay of the unchanged completed prefix, including edit-and-resume with a revised script (`resumeFromRunId`) |
| Model selection | Per-agent and per-phase routing across authenticated providers |
| Ultracode | `/ultracode` or `/effort ultra` |
| Additional Pi features | Worktree isolation, real cost accounting, deep research, and quality-pattern helpers |

</details>

## Determinism and limits

Workflow scripts run in a Node `vm` sandbox. `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, `new Date()`, `require`, `import`, filesystem access, and network access are unavailable inside the orchestration script. Subagents use their assigned tools; keeping the orchestrator deterministic is what makes journal replay reliable.

Journal replay — including edit-and-resume via `resumeFromRunId` — matches cached agent results by **positional call index** (the order in which `agent()` calls execute), the same contract Claude Code uses. Editing an `agent()` prompt in place reuses the cache up to that call and re-runs it and everything after. Inserting, removing, or reordering an `agent()` call before others shifts their positions and invalidates the cache from that point on (mismatched calls simply re-run — no crash). To preserve the cached prefix, keep the earlier still-good `agent()` calls unchanged and in the same order.

## Upgrading to 3.0

3.0 is a milestone release. Everything else is additive or a fix: the `workflow_control` tool (list/status/pause/resume/stop), edited-script resume, auto-resume on provider usage limits, and persistence/perf hardening. Requires pi ≥ 0.80.8.

Library API note: the unused `createSharedStoreTools` export was removed — use `createAgentStoreTools`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test     # Biome + TypeScript + unit tests
```

Features are also verified end-to-end against real Pi subagent sessions before release. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute.
